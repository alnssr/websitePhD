## Welcome to UMA PhD students seminar page

The PhD student seminar is a moment where students (PhD students, PostDocs, interns) can present their recent work or topics of intererst in front of the team. We regularly welcome students from other mathematics laboratories . It takes place every three weeks at ENSTA. 

This site is a collection of all the previous and upcoming PhD student seminars organized by the UMA team.
Next session will be on : **Friday 26 November 2021 at 2pm**.


### UMA
